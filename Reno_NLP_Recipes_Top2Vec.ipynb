    "## Exploring Top2Vec on Recipe Topic Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Guide here: https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "When running Top2Vec with Doc2Vec on the unmodified (only the initial quote and bracket removed from directions; both reformatted into a list of strings) directions and ingredients columns the topics returned were somewhat messy with words like recipe and ingredient sprinkled throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT returned far fewer topics on both columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the \"clean\" and preprocessed columns, BERT only returned two topics for the ingredients list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clean and preprocessed directions column was found to contain nan for some (31 total out of 22k) recipes where the directions were short such as \"Mix all the ingredients.\" and all words were removed during cleaning. There was one instance that numbers were the only characters present for both ingredients and directions. These were removed before running the topic generation model when the column of interest was impacted."
